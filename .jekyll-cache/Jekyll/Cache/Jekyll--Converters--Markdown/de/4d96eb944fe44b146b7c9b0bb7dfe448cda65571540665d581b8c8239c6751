I"ê<h2><b>Joining the Lab</b></h2>

<p>Weâ€™re glad youâ€™re interested in our research! Our group exists to train people to study geneticsâ€”especially evolutionary genetics, which is one of the most exciting areas of scienceâ€”using quantitative approaches. Training in the lab happens primarily via research projects. Trainees carry out original research and present it in the form of publications, software/scripts, talks to scientific audiences, and outreach to diverse audiences and the general public wherever appropriate.</p>

<p>Lab members may come from a variety of backgrounds. As part of their work in the lab, lab members write code and/or do math (mostly probability, stochastic processes, calculus, matrix algebra, and statistics). They also analyze genetic datasets. However, one doesnâ€™t need to know how to do all these things upon joining the lab; one of the main goals of time spent in the lab is to learn the relevant skills.</p>

<p><b>Postdoctoral researchers:</b> We are currently hiring postdocs. Remote work is expected during the current COVID-19 pandemic and negotiable afterward. Start date is flexible after August 16th, with earlier dates preferred. If you are interested in a postdoctoral position in the lab, please <a href="mailto: edgem@usc.edu">send Doc an email</a> briefly describing your past experience and current research interests. Please attach a CV with a list of references, as well as any recent work youâ€™d like to share.</p>

<p><b>PhD students:</b> People interested in doing a PhD in the lab should apply to USCâ€™s Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) program. During the first year of the program, students complete coursework in algorithms, statistics, and biology, and they also complete research rotations in up to three CBB-affiliated labs. Students interested in completing a PhD in the lab should arrange to do one of their rotations with us. CBB admissions are handled by the admissions committee and not by individual labs, but feel free to <a href="mailto: edgem@usc.edu">contact Doc</a> with questions or statements of interest.</p>

<p><b>Undergraduates, Masterâ€™s students, and others:</b> USC undergraduates interested in joining the lab should <a href="mailto: edgem@usc.edu">write to Doc</a>  with a CV, relevant course history, and statement of interest. Weâ€™ll arrange to meet and talk about available projects in the lab. QBIO undergraduates can apply to conduct honors thesis research in the lab. In cases of a compelling research fit, undergraduates or masterâ€™s students at other institutions may be able to arrange for paid summer or remote internships.</p>
