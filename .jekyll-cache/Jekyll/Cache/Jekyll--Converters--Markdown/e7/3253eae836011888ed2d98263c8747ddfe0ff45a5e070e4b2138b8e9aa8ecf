<b>Michael ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Edge</b>,  principal investigator. Doc is an assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at USC, in the Quantitative and Computational Biology section (QCB). His research group develops statistical methods and mathematical models in evolutionary genetics, with a particular focus on the intersections of evolutionary genetics with medical and forensic applications. Doc‚Äôs PhD in Biology is from Stanford University, where he was advised by Noah Rosenberg. He did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Davis, with Graham Coop. Doc also holds master‚Äôs degrees in statistics and psychology from UC Berkeley and a bachelor‚Äôs degree in human biology from Stanford University. Doc wrote a coursebook in statistics for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students, Statistical Thinking from Scratch, published by Oxford University Press.</p>

  <p><b>Linda Ding</b>,  graduate student. Linda is a graduate student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB). Prior to coming to USC, Linda completed a master‚Äôs degree in biostatistics from the University of Michigan and a bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics and psychology from the University of Toronto. Linda is studying statistical methods for understanding the evolution of polygenic traits using inferred ancestral recombination graphs. She also has interests in the genetics of risk for psychiatric conditions.</p>
