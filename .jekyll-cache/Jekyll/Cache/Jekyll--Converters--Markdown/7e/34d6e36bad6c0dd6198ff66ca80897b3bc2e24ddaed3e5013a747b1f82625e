Welcome! We are the Edge lab, a group of researchers studying evolutionary genetics at the University of Southern California (USC). We use math, statistics, and computation to study the sources and consequences of genetic variation. Doc Edge (principal investigator) is part of USCâ€™s Department of Biological Sciences, and part of the Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB) section, which administers the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) graduate program.</p>
