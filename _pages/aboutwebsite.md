This website is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and was made using the template available from the <a href="http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html">Allan Lab</a>. See their site for information on how to copy and modify the template for yourself. 

The lab logo was designed by Rosie Mottsmith inspired by a figure from [Schiffels and Durbin (2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3015). She also produced the schematic on the research page, inspired by a figure from [Edge & Coop (2020)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/51810). You may contact her for other designs or purchase her art at [meraguera.com](https://www.meraguera.com/).
