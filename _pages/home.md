Welcome! We are the Edge lab, a group of researchers studying evolutionary genetics at the University of Southern California (USC). We use math, statistics, and computation to study the sources and consequences of genetic variation. We are part of USCâ€™s Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB), which administers the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) graduate program.

We are located on the 4th floor of [Ray R. Irani Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/VnQFqEeUxaYJzyoe9) (RRI) at the University of Southern California, in the University Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.
